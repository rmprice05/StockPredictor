# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

This project demonstrates the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to predict stock prices. The model is built using Python, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn and yfinance.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict future stock prices based on historical data. The project involves the following steps:
1. Fetching historical stock data using yfinance.
2. Preprocessing the data.
3. Building and training an LSTM model.
4. Evaluating the model's performance.
5. Making future price predictions.

## Usage
1. Update the stock symbol in the script to analyze a different stock:
2. Run the script
